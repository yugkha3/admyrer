            Brief by Zomato

            Hi Rushabh,
            It was great connecting with you today. As discussed, we're looking to do a large mural/ graffiti painting activity in either Mumbai or Bangalore. The objective of this will be mass brand building and love for Zomato, hence the location needs to be one with high visibility and footfall. While we're working to find a suitable location for this, would love your input on the same as well.
            Could you therefore help us with a few details:
                - some sample images and per square foot rates of such similar activities done in the past - some location suggestions for the same, we're looking at roughly 50ft by 50ft but are flexible on this

        Example 2:
            Brief ny Insanely Good

        Example 3:
            Brief By Garnier

            Hi Rushabh,
            I hope you are doing well.
            Garnier is planning to execute a Pride campaign to support the LGBTQIA+ community in June. Sharing the tentative deck closed with the client with you here.
            The campaign will be activated offline and online.
            For the offline activation, the idea is to target colleges as we are looking to recruit people who are fairly young (Age 18-26) and are more likely to be vocal about a cause like this. You can check slides 16-21 to understand better.

            Idea 1:
                We will create a mural painting in the college campus where an artist will keep the sketch ready and people who support this community will come and paint the mural. We can look at colleges like design, architecture, media, and more. The only ask will be to have a better understanding of the crowd we are approaching. We are open to exploring locations.
                Could you please help us identify the artists for mural painting preferably from the LGBTQIA+ community and the colleges in Mumbai. Also, apart from college campuses could you also please tell us which are the places in Mumbai where we can execute this plan on- ground.
            Idea 2:
                We are also planning to set up a Hair Color Van inside the colleges. More finer details on this are to be closed soon on this.
                While sharing the list, would request you to
                1. Bifurcate it basis the city, and the top colleges we believe will work the best
                2. Share any best practices that we have in place for such activations
                3. Since we are planning to host this activity in June, and most of the colleges will be shut till the 10th of June, we'll need you to help us with timelines on activating this at the earliest.
            
            Let me know if you'd like to connect over a quick call tomorrow and discuss if there are any open points.
            Please share timelines on when can we expect the list of artists and colleges to come to us so that we can start looking into the finer details.
            Thank you.

            Brief by Unbottled
                Hi Rushabh,
                As per your discussion with Divisha, sharing the brief for the campaign as well as putting down a few points for clarification.
                    1. PFA is the plan that has been closed with the client. It has all the details of what is expected of the creators in this affiliate campaign as well as a vivid list of sample profiles. The brand is expecting profiles with similar followers and content quality to be a part of the affiliate program. Hence profiles being shared/suggested by you need to match the sample list. Please note that profiles can only be onboarded after approvals from the client.
                    2. We would expect you to be completely involved and play a proactive role in the execution of the campaign. While we will be assigning a POC to coordinate between you and the brand, we will also need you to be a part of crucial client calls as and when required at our discretion.
                    3. The campaign execution is set to begin on 1st May and will go on till 31st July. All influencer onboarding has to close before the execution starts.
                    4. While there are no fixed deliverables committed to the client, we will be measuring Link clicks as our primary KPI and reach, views, and engagement as our secondary KPI. We would need influencers to push as much content as possible across these 3 months to get the maximum link clicks, reach, views, and engagement.
                    5. The payment amount quoted by you is INR 2,00,000/- for the entire campaign. The same will be credited to you 30 days after the completion of the entire campaign with 500 creators as per the plan. In case you are unable to complete the entire campaign as per the plan and brand expectations, we will only be able to clear payments to you as per the terms on which the brand pays us.
                    6. Please remember that this is an affiliate plan and sales are of utmost importance. While there are no committed sales volumes, we would need you to push and encourage the influencers to achieve as many conversations as possible.
                
                Kindly share your conformation on the same, so that we can proceed on it with the client as well. Would also need you to share the first list of creators that you want to suggest for this campaign by Friday first half. Please ensure a certain degree of intent is taken from the these creators before sending it to us for client's approval.
